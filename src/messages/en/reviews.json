        "quote": "For the first time in almost 50 years, I was able to have a dental appointment without pain! When the doctor suggested using anesthesia for my dental cleaning (she already knew how nervous I get), I told her no because I was afraid of the needle 🙈 — but thank God she insisted. I can honestly say it was the best dental cleaning I’ve ever had in my life. Besides doing an excellent job, I was completely calm, and so was she 🤲. The doctor is the best — so patient, and I didn’t feel even the slightest discomfort. She is incredible at administering anesthesia; you can’t even feel it, and we had the best treatment 🙌🙌🙌 Thank you, thank you, thank you! 🦷😍",

She has treated me with aligners and my 7-year-old daughter since she was 5, with preventive orthodontics. We recommend her 1000%. If you’re looking for an excellent dentist and orthodontic specialist, Dr. Guillén is the best 👍🏼 We give her 5 stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",
