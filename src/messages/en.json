When the doctor suggested using anesthesia for my dental cleaning (she had previously experienced how nervous this patient gets), I said no because I was afraid of the needle 🙈 but thank God she insisted, and I can say it was the best dental cleaning I’ve ever had. She did an excellent job, I was very relaxed and so was she 🤲... The doctor is the best — so patient, I didn’t feel even a little discomfort. She’s the best at applying anesthesia — you don’t even feel it — and we had the best treatment 🙌🙌🙌 Thank you thank you thank you 🦷😍",
